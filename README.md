### **Predicting Cow Pregnancy Outcomes using Health Data**
This project uses data collected by farms at CSU to predict the outcome of pregnancies in cows. There are three .ipynb files that are in a specific order:

1. Wrangling and Exploration.ipynb
   - Format the data for modeling.
   - Visualize and exlpore data.
2. ModelTesting.ipynb
   - Test different models, hyperparameters, features, etc. to maximize metrics on the validation set.
3. FinalModel.ipynb
   - Use the final model that was settled on in [2] on the test set.
   - Present results.

Data was collectedat CSU farms. I recieved it from Dr. Pinedo and Dr. Alvarez in the Department of Animal Sciences .
