### **Predicting Cow Pregnancy Outcomes using Health Data**
This project uses data collected by farms at CSU to predict the outcome of pregnancies in cows. There are three .ipynb files that are in a specific order:


1. Wrangling and Exploration.ipynb
   - Format the data for modeling.
   - Visualize and exlpore data.
2. ModelTesting.ipynb
   - Test different models, hyperparameters, features, etc. to maximize metrics on the validation set.
3. FinalModel.ipynb
   - Use the final model that was settled on in [2] on the test set.
   - Present results.

Data was collectedat CSU farms. I recieved it from Dr. Pinedo and Dr. Alvarez in the Department of Animal Sciences. The raw datset was too large, but the cleaned data can be found in this repository at DOWNSAMPLEcleanDataApr22.csv and unusedDataApr22.csv.
